                <p>
                    <bold>Background</bold>: Magnetic sorting of cells, based on &#x00a0;microbead conjugated antibodies (Abs), employs positive as well as negative immunomagnetic separation methods, for isolation of a specific cell population. These microbeads are suggested to be nontoxic, biodegradable carriers conjugated to various antibodies. Isolation of cells through positive selection involves the attachment of antibody conjugated microbeads to the cells of interest, followed by their isolation in the presence of a strong magnetic field to obtain higher purity. Negative selection involves attachment of microbead conjugated antibodies to all other cell populations except the cells of interest, which remain untagged. In the present study, we compared the two methods for their effect on functional and immunophenotypic behavior of isolated CD14+ monocytes.</p>
                <p> 
                    <bold>Methods</bold>: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood collected from healthy volunteers by density gradient centrifugation. Human blood derived monocytes were isolated through positive selection and negative selection, making use of the appropriate monocyte isolation kit. Monocytes were then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and their activation and proliferation capacity were examined. The degradation or dissociation of cell-bound microbeads was also investigated.</p>
                <p> 
                    <bold>Results</bold>: We observed an impaired LPS sensitivity as well as poor activation and proliferation capacity upon stimulation by LPS in positively sorted CD14+ monocytes as compared to negatively sorted CD14+ monocytes. The attached microbeads did not degrade and remained attached to the cells even after 6 days of culture.</p>
                <p> 
                    <bold>Conclusions</bold>: Our results suggest that positively sorted CD14+ cells exhibit hampered functionality and may result in inaccurate analysis and observations in downstream applications. However, these cells can be used for immediate analytical procedures.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Magnetic sorting is a common technique used to obtain a highly pure population of cells of interest from a mixed population of cells, making use of microbead conjugated antibodies against the cell surface antigen. Positive sorting involves the tagging of cells with magnetic microbead conjugated antibodies, followed by isolation of the labeled cells by placing them in a magnetic field. After positive sorting, cells that have microbead conjugated antibodies on their surface can be conveniently analyzed using flow cytometry (

                    <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Negative sorting involves the labeling of all cells, except the cells of interest, by incubating them in a cocktail of magnetic microbead conjugated antibodies and subsequently removing them by placing them in a magnetic field.</p>
            <p>Cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) are specific markers used to identify monocytic populations, and they act as a coreceptors for LPS (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11">Guha &amp; Mackman, 2001</xref>). Since CD14 lacks a cytoplasmatic domain, the positive magnetic sorting of CD14 may not be expected to trigger any signal transduction pathways or alter its functionality. However it has been demonstrated that anti-CD14 antibody reduces LPS responsiveness of monocytes (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Kim &amp; Kim, 2014</xref>).</p>
            <p>We investigated the immunophenotypic behaviour and molecular characteristics of monocytes after both positive and negative sorting, by analyzing their response and proliferation to stimuli like LPS. The biodegradation profile of the attached microbeads from the CD14+ cells was also investigated.</p>

                <p>Sorted monocytes incubated with LPS were examined for secretion of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The levels of IL-8, IL-10, TGF-&#x03b2;1 and RANTES at different time points after positively and negatively isolated CD14+ monocytes were incubated with LPS were analyzed. The secretion of IL-8 was observed to be at its maximum at 8 hours in negatively sorted monocytes and at 16 hours in positively sorted monocytes (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The IL-8 level in negatively sorted CD14+ cells was 6 times higher than positively sorted CD14+ cells. A similar pattern was observed for secretion of RANTES (

            <p>Magnetic cell sorting for the separation of large numbers of cells according to specific cell surface markers is a technique that is commonly used. It is a common notion that magnetic beads are biodegradable, do not activate cells and do not affect downstream application. We have however observed that the activation and proliferation of positively sorted CD14+ cells is impaired compared to the negatively sorted cells.</p>
            <p>The activation of monocytes by LPS is known to occur through surface CD14, which is an LPS sensing receptor. Surface CD14 plays a crucial role; it binds and transfers LPS to the surface via TLR4:MD2 complex to enable its recognition. The LPS stimulation of monocytes activates several intracellular signaling pathways which in turn activates a variety of transcription factors ultimately leading to induction of many genes encoding inflammatory cytokines (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11">Guha &amp; Mackman, 2001</xref>). In short, CD14 is involved in the LPS-induced release of IL-8, which is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-12">He 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>).</p>
            <p>After positively sorting CD14+ monocytes from PBMCs, the surface CD14 molecules on monocytes are blocked by anti-CD14 microbeads and these CD14+ surface sites can no longer mediate the stimulation by LPS and the positively sorted CD14+ monocytes may show impaired stimulation by LPS.</p>
            <p>In two experiments, identical numbers of CD14+ monocytes isolated by positive and negative sorting were stimulated with LPS and their activation and proliferation was monitored. 
                <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows that upon stimulation by LPS the negatively sorted CD14+ monocytes secreted enormous amount of IL-8 almost instantaneously and they exhibited acute proliferation (
                <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). This is in accordance with the observation that IL-8 transcript is highly expressed in LPS-stimulated monocytes (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">Standiford 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">Suzuki 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>).</p>
            <p>The positively sorted CD14+ monocytes responded only after 24 hours, and their level of stimulation was impaired and the cells did not proliferate. This delayed and reduced stimulation by LPS is due to the CD14 independent receptors which function to direct LPS mediated cytokine secretion under conditions where the CD14 dependent pathway is blocked or non-functional (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-16">Lynn 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). There are a few LPS-associated cell surface proteins which are distinct from CD14 and these surface proteins too can bind TLRs to initiate a response (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-27">Triantafilou 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Our results suggest that the density of these surface proteins is low compared to CD14 as lesser stimulation was observed when CD14 surface groups were blocked by Abs and secondly, the delayed stimulation indicate that most likely a different pathway was followed for their activation.</p>
            <p>Further, the secretion of somewhat higher amount of IL-10 by positively sorted CD14+ monocytes only suggest the absence of highly inflammatory conditions upon LPS activation. The levels of RANTES and TGF-&#x03b2;1 also indicate that the LPS activation of monocytes via CD14 independent receptors produces unique results which could be very different from common experimental situation. </p>
            <p>In one such related report, the, human primary monocytes were isolated by either positive or negative immunomagnetic selection and differentiated to macrophages (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Neu 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The phagocytosis of 
                <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (Lm) by GM-CSF-derived macrophages (GM-M) was markedly influenced by the method used for isolation of monocytes. The GM-M derived from negatively isolated monocytes showed low phagocytosis of Lm whereas GM-M generated from positively selected monocytes displayed high phagocytosis of Lm. The paper concludes that macrophages derived by 
                <italic>ex vivo</italic> differentiation of negatively selected human primary monocytes as the most suitable model to study Lm infection of macrophages. In yet another report (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">Elkord 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) it was demonstrated that the human dendritic cells generated from positively isolated monocytes by anti-CD14-coated microbeads show impaired induction by LPS.</p>
            <p>Beliakova-Bethell 
                <italic>et al.</italic> (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">Beliakova-Bethell 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) examined  the gene expression profiles of CD8+ T cells, B cells and monocytes isolated using positive selection, negative selection and FACS. They concluded that gene expression signatures were more similar between cells isolated by negative selection and FACS compared to cells isolated by positive selection. These findings were made on cells immediately after isolation and our findings establish the long-term effects of positive and negative isolation methods. In these reports it was not investigated further why the positively isolated monocytes were not suitable and had poor cytokines production upon stimulation. Our data suggests that in these experiments, the positively isolated monocytes were tagged permanently with anti-CD14 molecules attached with microbeads. The positively isolated CD14+ monocytes are identical with monocytes whose surface CD14 molecules have been blocked by Abs and these monocytes are known to behave differently (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Delirezh

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Kim &amp; Kim, 2014</xref>).</p>
            <p>An alternate strategy to positively isolate monocytes could be by using anti-CD33 coated beads instead of anti-CD14 coated beads. The monocytes isolated using this approach too most likely will result in impaired response upon LPS stimulation. It has been reported  that CD33 and CD14 are colocalized on cell surface and when monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence of CD33 antibody, the production of IL-12 and phosphorylation of NF-&#x03ba;B decreased significantly (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">Ishida 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The monocytes culture in the presence of anti-CD33 and the positively isolated monocytes using anti-CD33 coated beads, both have antibody bound CD33, and both are likely to respond in a similar manner.</p>
            <p>In this context, diverse outcome could be observed when cells positively isolated by antibody bound microbeads were used for extended culture work (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Govers 
                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>;

                    <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p>
            <p>There are two important findings from these experiments; positively isolated CD14+ monocytes have impaired LPS sensitivity and magnetic beads used in positive isolation do not degrade within days. These conclusions suggest that for most experiments, positively isolated cells are usable for analysis purpose only and should not be used for any further culture experiments.</p>

            <p>In the current manuscript, the authors have investigated the impact of positive selection and negative selection on the activation, function, and proliferation of&#x00a0;monocytes. It is an important study as many researchers use these techniques interchangeably, greatly impacting the final outcome of the study and erroneous conclusion. Though the current study has used only a few experiments to draw the conclusion, their&#x00a0;study design was neat.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The authors may clarify some minor points to make the manuscript better:

                    <list-item>
                        <p>In the introduction section, the authors have written: "CD14 lacks a cytoplasmatic domain and such cells are reported to function in a restricted manner" - a brief explanation of what is meant by&#x00a0;restricted manner would be helpful.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The sentence on page number 5 reads: 'These were the cells from which the microbeads were either degraded or "
                            <bold>detected</bold>" and cells were without microbeads.' : Probably instead of detected, it will be detached.&#x00a0;</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>Is the size of the beads known? Can there be a size-dependent effect due to steric hindrance of the CD14 bound beads to the TLR4? If only antibody is used, can we see the same effect? The main function of CD14 in LPS signaling in monocytes is it binds with&#x00a0;LPS binding protein (LBP).&#x00a0;The role of LBP appears to be that of aiding LPS to dock at the LPS receptor complex by initially binding LPS and then forming a ternary complex with CD14, thus enabling LPS to be transferred to the LPS receptor complex composed of TLR4&#x00a0;and MD-2. As in these in vitro studies, LBP has not been used, probably CD14 may not directly affect the LPS binding with the TLR4 receptor.</p>

                <p> Nano meter size beads are used is cells isolation and these are unlikely to create significant steric hindrance. The main point is that once Ab-conjugated beads get bound to the antigen cell surface (CD14 in present case); it is bound to influence the expression, transcription and translation machinery inside the cell. And secondly, as a result of conjugation of cell surface CD14 molecule with Ab-conjugated bead in cells isolation step, the cell surface CD14 molecule would no longer be available for LBP to initiate the activation cascade.</p>
                <p> This has been elaborated in the Introduction section of the revised manuscript.</p>

            <p>This study assesses monocyte function following isolation of these cells from total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using positive or negative immunomagnetic selection. It addresses an important topic, because cell isolation procedure may affect cell function and skew conclusions obtained from 
                <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of immune cells isolated from blood. Despite a limited assessment of functions and isolation methods, this study should have an impact on selection of monocyte isolation protocol when these cells are intended for investigation of specific responses, which this study tested. The study design is appropriate and conclusions drawn are adequately supported by the results. The paper may be improved, however, by providing more details in methods, raw data and discussion, and by careful revision of citations as detailed below:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Methods:</p>
            <p> Cytometic bead array: there are several cytometric bead arrays available for human samples (e.g. &#x201c;human inflammatory cytokine kit&#x201d;, &#x201c;human chemokine kit&#x201d;). Which one was used? Legend for Figure 1 indicates that 5 samples were pooled. It would be helpful to provide details on how the pooling was done (the entire samples, equal volumes, equal proportions?) and what dilutions were made for the assay.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Live cell imaging: It appears that information in methods contradicts the data shown in Figure 2. According to the figure and supplied raw data, imaging was performed over a course of over 76 hours, while methods section states &#x201c;48 hours&#x201d;.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Raw data:</p>
            <p> Data for Figure 1: it might be easier to understand the data if columns were labeled by cytokine and sample (e.g. IL8 negative selection, IL8 positive selection, etc. as opposed to IL8B, IL8C, etc.)</p>
            <p> Data for Figure 2: were 36 fields for each sample for each time point individually counted, as the information on the figure indicates? Raw data appears to have only the averages. Was the distribution of counts tight, or was there high variation? Including raw data for individual field counts might be more appropriate.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Discussion:</p>
            <p> Another option to positively isolate monocytes is to use anti-CD33 instead of anti-CD14 coated beads. This may be more appropriate in studies that aim to measure response to LPS, when positive selection is preferred (e.g. in cases of limited sample from which sequential separation of different lymphocyte subsets is desired). It might be worthy to discuss this option.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Citations:</p>
            <p> Several citations throughout the paper appear to be inaccurate; for example, in Introduction some citations on altered behavior of cells following microbead attachment: (1) Safarik and Safarikova is a method review, and Horgan et al. is a protocol; neither studies cell behavior; (2) Semple et al. observed no functional changes in limited tests they did; the difference that they report pertains to CD19+ vs CD19- cells, not positively isolated vs negatively isolated cells; (3) Fuchslin et al. labeled bacterial cells for their quantification in water; and Ribaut et al. labeled parasites for their isolation from infected blood for research purposes; the relevance of these two citations for the present study may be questionable. In Discussion, Adams et al. describe a special case of MACS for multitarget sort, and may not be appropriate for referencing commonality of magnetic sorting. While the results from the present study are consistent with gene expression studies by Beliakova-Bethell et al. in terms of effects of positive selection, the reference to Beliakova-Bethell et al. is made following description of Neu et al. and Elkord et al. studies, stating that the findings were similar. This is not accurate because Neu et al. and Elkord et al. performed functional assessment following cell separation, while Beliakova-Bethell et al. lysed the cells immediately after isolation and did not measure cell function. Instead of the statement of similarity of findings, it might be worth pointing out that positive selection affects monocytes the most both in the short term and in the long term.</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>
            <p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>

                <p> During the live cell imaging experiment images were logged and later cells were counted using the Cell-IQ Analyser software. The protocol for cell counting in the analysis software was assembled to finally provide the average number of cell count in the selected fields. The cell counts from individual fields of various images were embedded in the analysis software, thought it was possible to export these tables but due to very large number of data files we focussed only on the averages.&#x00a0;</p>

                    <italic> Another option to positively isolate monocytes is to use anti-CD33 instead of anti-CD14 coated beads. This may be more appropriate in studies that aim to measure response to LPS, when positive selection is preferred (e.g. in cases of limited sample from which sequential separation of different lymphocyte subsets is desired). It might be worthy to discuss this option.</italic>

                <p> This is a good suggestion keeping in mind that the CD14 is an endogenous ligand for CD33 in monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells. It has been reported (Hiroshi Nakada et al.; J Biol Chem. 2014 Sep 5; 289(36): 25341&#x2013;25350) that when monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence of anti-CD33Ab, the production of IL-12 and phosphorylation of NF-&#x03ba;B decreased significantly.</p>
                <p> Most likely the positively isolated monocytes using CD33-Ab beads would behave in a similar manner.</p>
                <p> This possibility has been discussed in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p>
