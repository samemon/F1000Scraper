            <p>Nodular colloid degeneration (NCD), also named paracolloid, is a rare subtype of colloid deposition disorders. It presents as a single or multiple soft to rubbery nodules or plaques usually on chronically sun-exposed skin.

Here, we present a case of NCD that occurred on the face and discuss the topic of how to discriminate between NCD and other similar entities such as nodular amyloidosis.</p>

            <p>A previously healthy 58-year-old farmer from Hamedan province, Iran, presented to the dermatology clinic with a three year history of multiple papular and nodular lesions on his face. The lesions had been gradually enlarging during last six months. An examination of the skin carried out by a dermatologist revealed multiple skin-colored to yellow papules and nodules of different sizes (10&#x2013;25mm) located on the forehead, cheeks, and nares (

                <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The nodules were painless and mobile, they were rubbery-soft in consistency and were attached to the overlying skin. Findings of the systemic physical examination were otherwise unremarkable.</p>

            <p>After local anesthesia using 2&#x2013;3ml of intralesional lidocaine (2%), an excisional biopsy was obtained from forehead lesions.

            <p>Histopathologic examination revealed hyperkeratosis, flattened epidermis, and amorphous eosinophilic material deposits in the upper dermis, which were separated from the epidermis by a Grenz zone of collagen fibers and extended into the deep dermis. The hair follicles and sebaceous glands were well preserved. There were some irregular fissures and clefts in the hyaline material dividing this material into smaller islands. Scattered nuclei of fibroblast were aligned along the line of fissuring (

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>Colloid milium and colloid degeneration are rare degenerative cutaneous disorders, with at least four distinct clinicopathological variants. The four variants of this disease are as follows: adult colloid milium, juvenile colloid milium, pigmented colloid milium, and nodular colloid degeneration (para colloid)
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>In both the adult and juvenile forms, numerous yellow-brown, semitranslucent dome-shaped papules are developed in areas of chronic sun exposure; for example, the cheeks, ears, neck, and dorsum of the hands. In pigmented colloid milium, gray to black grouped or confluent papules are present on the face, following the excessive use of topical hydroquinone for skin bleaching
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>NCD clinically presents with solitary or multiple asymptomatic nodules or plaque-like lesions usually in chronically sun-exposed areas, particularly the face. The lesions have been rarely reported on sun protected areas such as penile skin
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">3</xref>
                </sup>. Although the exact etiologic role of chronic sun exposure remains uncertain, it is suggested that photo-induced damage to dermal elastic fibers, as in solar elastosis, produce the colloid
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4">4</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>Clinically, the differential diagnosis of NCD includes nodular amyloidosis, nodular mastocytosis, nodular histiocytosis, steatocystoma multiplex, sarcoidosis, lepromatous leprosy, leishmaniasis, cutaneous lymphoma, and pseudolymphoma
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">1</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>
                </sup>. A histopathologic workup is a helpful tool in establishing the appropriate diagnosis. Upon histopathologic examination, an amorphous eosinophilic material with small fissure and clefts is observed in the dermis, separated from the epidermis by a Grenz zone of narrow collagen tissue
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">5</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>Histologically, NCD must be distinguished from lipoid proteinosis, different types of colloid milium, and amyloidosis. In cutaneous lesions of lipoid proteinosis, there are masses of amorphous or laminated hyaline-like PAS-positive deposits in the dermis that have the striking perivascular pattern and also can surround the eccrine glands as well as the hair follicles and sebaceous glands
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">6</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>In juvenile colloid milium, amorphous eosinophilic deposits are found in the dermis next to basal layer without Grenz zone. In adult colloid milium, nodules of homogenous eosinophilic colloid material expand the papillary dermis and extend into the mid dermis. Fissures and clefts divide this material into smaller islands and evidence of solar elastosis are commonly seen beneath the nodules. The Grenz zone is often present in the dermis. A pigmented colloid milium is similar to adult colloid milium but contains an area of yellow-brown islands of colloid material in the upper dermis. Nodular colloid degeneration is distinguished from adult colloid milium and juvenile colloid milium by more deeply extended and less conspicuous clefting of amorphous materials within the dermis
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">7</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>The main histologic differential diagnosis of nodular colloid degeneration includes nodular amyloidosis. In nodular amyloidosis, there are large masses of amyloid in the dermis and subcutaneous fat, accentuate around deep vascular channels, adnexal structures, and infiltrate blood vessel walls
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">8</xref>
                </sup>. Infiltration of plasma cells are usually present in and around the amyloid deposition
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">7</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>There is a considerable resemblance between colloid milium and amyloidosis, as both may stain positively for Congo red, PAS and crystal violet, and produce fluorescence with Thioflavin-T. In contrast to colloid, amyloid reacts with Pagoda-red and other cotton dyes
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">8</xref>
                </sup>. Moreover, infiltrate of plasma cells and positive immunostaining for light chain deposition can aid in the differentiation of amyloidosis from NCD
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">8</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>To improve the appearance of the lesions, cryotherapy, dermabrasion, erbium:YAG or carbon dioxide laser resurfacing have been reported as effective methods, although lesions may recur. Considering the pathogenesis of NCD, sun protection can be effective in preventing NCD
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>
                </sup>. In this case, we used excision and Co2 laser resurfacing to flatten the lesions. Unfortunately, the patient did not return for follow-up and we could not obtain data on treatment efficacy, cosmetic results or recurrence.</p>
            <p>In summary, we encountered a rare case of nodular colloid degeneration arising on the face, which was diagnosed by histopathological examination. Although it is rare, the clinical diagnosis of nodular colloid degeneration should be considered in differential diagnosis of any cases presenting with facial nodules.</p>

            <p>The authors describe a very interesting case of nodular type milium colloid associated to UV radiation. It affirms the association demonstrated in several studies. The authors have made an appropriate review of the topic. I consider that after some minimum suggested changes the article</p>
            <p> should be indexed.</p>

                        <p>Dear authors, it would be interesting to create a comparative table of the 12 cases reported in the literature. It should include possible causes, clinical features, histopathology, treatments performed and evolution of the cases.</p>
